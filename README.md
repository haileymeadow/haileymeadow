## Hi there 👋

My name is Hailey and I am an environmental science student with a passion for nature and it's technological applications! I love working on projects related to Mycology, Protozoology, Ecology and Conservation through R and GIS Applications. 

# About Me
- 🔭 I’m currently working on MycoMaps, a github repository project that includes Fungal and Protozoan data sets and applications for R and GIS Systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced GIS techniques, R, and data analysis.
- 🍄 I’m looking to collaborate on Ecology data science projects! I am particularly interested in Mycology and Protozoology, but I am passionate about all types of ecosystems.
